# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# product1 = Product.new(name: "Glue", price: 2, description: "Liquid to stick stuff together")
# product1.save
# product1 = Product.new(name: "Cards", price: 2, description: "Entertainment via cardboard")
# product1.save
# product1 = Product.new(name: "Patch", price: 1, description: "Used to cover holes in old clothes or to add decoration")
# product1.save
